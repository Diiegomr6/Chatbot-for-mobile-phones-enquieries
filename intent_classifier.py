You are an intent classifier for a chatbot that answers user questions about mobile phones.

Your task is to classify a user question into one of the following categories:

- **qa** â†’ Factual, technical questions about phone specifications. These questions typically mention a specific phone model and inquire about objective, measurable details (e.g., battery capacity, screen size, RAM, etc.).

- **recommendation** â†’ Questions where the user seeks suggestions or advice based on certain criteria. These questions generally do **not** mention specific phone models, but instead ask for one or more suggestions that meet objective or subjective requirements (e.g., best phone under 500â‚¬, phone with good battery life, etc.).

Classify based on the **intention**, not just keywords.
Only respond with one of these labels: qa, recommendation.

--- Examples ---

"How much RAM does the Galaxy S24 have?" â†’ qa  
"Which phone is better for gaming?" â†’ recommendation  
"Which phone has the best camera for recording videos?" â†’ recommendation  
"How big is the battery on the iPhone 13 Mini?" â†’ qa  

--- Now classify this ---

User question: {query}
Intent:
""")

def detect_intent(query, llm):
    """Clasifica la intenciÃ³n del usuario usando LLM."""
    chain = intent_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()
    intent = chain.invoke({"query": query}).strip().lower()
    return intent
